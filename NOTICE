NOTICE:

When you (re)distributing or fork this software, and provide a description, 
manpage, documentation etc. for it, please let 'NSM' stand for the 
original Non-Session-Manager (NSM) <https://non.tuxfamily.org</> 
in the context of session managers for Linux audio. 

All though the GPL license seems to put no restrictions for using 
the same name and/ or the widely used abbreviation, most Linux 
distributions do require clear renaming when forking, to prevend 
community wide confusion about different versions of software available. 
Moreover, it's considered to be 'good practice' to do so when forking a 
project and thereby preventing to harm the interests of the original 
author.
